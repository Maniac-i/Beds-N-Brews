# Beds-N-Brews: Project 1 ReadMe

## Overview

```
For Project 1, our team was asked to use the skills we have gained thus far at 
The Ohio State University Coding Boot Camp to build a web application from 
scratch. Our web application must integrate data received from multiple 
server-side API requests to solve a real-world problem.
